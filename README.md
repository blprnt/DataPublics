Course Description:
---

In this course we’ll investigate two closely related ideas: public data and data publics. We’ll learn how to access and represent data from an assortment of existing public data sources, how to liberate currently obfuscated data sets, and how to create our own useful/whimsical/critical APIs from scratch. We’ll also investigate the act of putting data into public space - through sculpture, projections, performance, and participatory interventions. Particular attention will be paid to methods which bring data back to communities from which it was collected, and to tactics which build grassroots literacies, respect local ways of knowing and reinforce capabilities for stewardship and sovereignty. 

## Expectations and Workload

You can expect to have three assigned readings for each thematic section (these are marked as readings underneat the section headings - weekly resources are not mandatory but are pretty rad.) You must complete all readings prior to class, and come ready to participate in discussion. Details for how to submit assignments will be given in class.

## Grading

If we were using a percentage-based grading system, the numbers would look something like this:

Class participation: 30%
Assignments + Semester Projects: 70%
Since we’re not using a percentage-based grading system, let me put it another way: if you’re an active contributor to our discussions in class, and you complete your assignments, and you make something ambitious/excellent as a final project, you’ll pass this class. If you don’t, you won’t.

## Class Rules

(i) Everyone does their best to show up to class on time. If you’re going to be late, let me know in advance. If you need to miss a class for any reason, you must also let me know in advance.

(ii) Everyone does the readings. For the most part, they’re short, fun, and useful.

(iii) All assignment work is due at the beginning of class. Everyone gets a free pass for one late assignment. After that, any assignments not ready for the start of class will be counted as incomplete.

(iv) Everyone in the class must attend office hours at least once in first four weeks of class.

(v) We’ll have a series of guest speakers coming into class over the course of the term. I will provide resources to learn about their work prior to their visits – everyone in class must do their homework and be prepared to learn from our guests.

(vi) I am 100% dedicated to a inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, or religion. I will not tolerate harassment of class participants in any form.


# Section 1 - Public Data
What is public data? What kind of information is available and how can we access it? How can we start thinking critically about what data are made public, and what data are not?

### Resources:

(Link to projects shown in class will be posted here)

### Small Assignment (due next week): 

Working in groups of 3, identify a public data set and produce a small (< 10 page) zine explaining what it is & how to get information from it, but also why it was made, and what might be missing. 

Class 2 - 2/5/20 - A lossy kind of Alchemy

Class 4 - 2/19/19 - Field Trip
------------

Field Trip! We'll visit 2-3 public artworks in New York that put data into public space. We'll consider the multitude of design & commiunications considerations that ariste from making work which is physical, which exists in non-digital timescales, and which touches the quotidian experience of commuters, tourists, locals and passers-by.

# Section 2: Data publics

How does the experience of data change when it occurs in a public space? How can real-world interactions with data more deeply engage with individuals and communities and how might it foster more critical thinking about data, power, and consequences? How can siting projects in real places more meaningfully speak to the localness of data?

# Section 3: Case Study - The Map Room

In 2017, we turned the gymnasium of an abandoned school in St. Louis's North City and made it into a space for map-makign, data exploration, and dialogue. Since then, we've been workign to develop The Map Room as a wide-ranging platform to encourage social convening around data, and to critically question how people and communities are seen through data's lens. We'll introduce the project, and then run a map room of our own to see how it all works.
