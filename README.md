Course Description:
---

In this course we’ll investigate two closely related ideas: public data and data publics. We’ll learn how to access and represent data from an assortment of existing public data sources, how to liberate currently obfuscated data sets, and how to create our own useful/whimsical/critical APIs from scratch. We’ll also investigate the act of putting data into public space - through sculpture, projections, performance, and participatory interventions. Particular attention will be paid to methods which bring data back to communities from which it was collected, and to tactics which build grassroots literacies, respect local ways of knowing and reinforce capabilities for stewardship and sovereignty. 

## Expectations and Workload

You can expect to have a few assigned readings and videos to watch for each thematic section (these are marked as readings underneat the section headings - weekly resources are not mandatory but are typically pretty rad.) You must complete all readings prior to class, and come ready to participate in discussion. Details for how to submit assignments will be given in class.

## Grading

If we were using a percentage-based grading system, the numbers would look something like this:

Class participation: 30%
Assignments + Semester Projects: 70%
Since we’re not using a percentage-based grading system, let me put it another way: if you’re an active contributor to our discussions in class, and you complete your assignments, and you make something ambitious/excellent as a final project, you’ll pass this class. If you don’t, you won’t.

## Land Notice
Each week of this course, we'll gathered on the unceded land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples. I ask you to join me in acknowledging the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and present, as well as future generations. I also acknowledge that NYU and ITP was founded upon exclusions and erasures of many Indigenous peoples, including those on whose land this institution is located. This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism.

## This Syllabus is in Flux
And it will probably remain so for the rest of the course. I expect things to change as we get a sense of our shared goals, and an ideal pace of learning. Please check in here regularly.

## Class Rules

(i) Everyone does their best to show up to class on time. If you’re going to be late, let me know in advance. If you need to miss a class for any reason, you must also let me know in advance.

(ii) Everyone does the readings. For the most part, they’re short, fun, and useful.

(iii) All assignment work is due at the beginning of class. Everyone gets a free pass for one late assignment. After that, any assignments not ready for the start of class will be counted as incomplete.

(iv) Everyone in the class must attend office hours at least once in first four weeks of class.

(v) We’ll have a series of guest speakers coming into class over the course of the term. I will provide resources to learn about their work prior to their visits – everyone in class must do their homework and be prepared to learn from our guests.

(vi) I am 100% dedicated to a inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, or religion. I will not tolerate harassment of class participants in any form. I will address you by your name and pronouns. Your health and well being is my first concern, and I will do my best not to add to the over-stressed conditions that programs like ITP unfortunately cultivate.

# Section 1 - Public Data
What is public data? What kind of information is available and how can we access it? How can we start thinking critically about what data are made public, and what data are not?

In this section we'll look at the basics of getting data and representing it, learning how to work with common data formats and open APIs, and building skills with visualization tools to explore, communicate and critique public data.

Class 1 - 1/29/20 - Everyone needs to start somewhere
------------

- Introductions + class instructions
- Collaborative discussion on course goals + outcomes
- Why data and publics? 
- Review of interesting/intriguing projects that bring data into public space. 

### Resources:

(Link to projects shown in class will be posted here)

### Small Assignment (due next week): 

Working in groups of 3, identify a public data set and produce a small (< 10 page) zine explaining what it is & how to get information from it, but also why it was made, and what might be missing. 

Class 2 - 2/5/20 - A lossy kind of Alchemy
------------

Data visualization is, at its root, a simple thing. In this class we'll start with the basics of turning numbers into stuff on the screen, workign with simple public data examples and P5.js. We'll also begin discussions about how the choices we make in data visualization can drastically affect the ways in which data are (and aren't) communicated.

Class 3 - 2/12/20 - This to that
------------

We'll continue last week's work on data visualization, this time looking at how libraries lik D3.js can streamline straight-forward data visualiztion tasks. At the same time, we'll consider how the tools we use are tailored toward specific literacies, and how breaking out of common viz tropes might allow us to speak more widely to the public.

# Section 2: Data publics

How does the experience of data change when it occurs in a public space? How can real-world interactions with data more deeply engage with individuals and communities and how might it foster more critical thinking about data, power, and consequences? How can siting projects in real places more meaningfully speak to the localness of data?

Class 5 - 2/26/19 - Beyond Visualization
------------

Data can be mapped to almost anything, to things so creative and bizarre that they make even the most radical paper and screen-based visualizations (or gigantic piles of rice) seem downright staid. We'll look at examples of radical data visualization, and tools and techniques that can be useful for getting beyond the visual.

### Small Assignment

Create a data representation of public data (now loosely defined) which is experienced primarily with a sense other than sight (hearing, touch, smell, taste). Due Class 6.


Class 6 - 3/4/19 - Participatory Engagement
------------

The ways in which we typically interact with data are lonely - and often isolating. Also, the systems of data collection and computation are often left out of the picture. How can we envision new modes of engagement with data that are more active, and participatory? Can these modes lead to more agency?

### Medium Assignment

For class 8, be prepared to give a 3 minute overview to the class about your idea for the final project (details about Final Project requirements will be outlined in this class)

Class 7 - 3/11/19 - Data And Performance
------------

Data live utilitarian lives. From the moment they are conceived, as measurements of some thing or system or person, they are conscripted to the cause of being useful. They are fed into algorithms, clustered and merged, mapped and reduced. They are graphed and charted, plotted and visualized. A rare datum might find itself turned into sound, or, more seldom, manifested as a physical object. Always, though, the measure of the life of data is in its utility. Data that are collected but not used are condemned to a quiet life in a database. They dwell in obscure tables, are quickly discarded, or worse (cue violin) – labelled as ‘exhaust’.

Perhaps this isn’t the only role for a datum? To be operated on? To be useful? Might data find new ways to speak through performance?

- Review of data + performance projects
- Techniques and tools

* A Sort of Joy - Thousands of Exhausted Things - https://medium.com/memo-random/a-sort-of-joy-1d9d5ff02ac9
* Rivers, Rats and RNNs (Brian House) - https://vimeo.com/287093394

### Medium Assignment:
Working in groups of 2 or 3, write and carry out a data performance. Performances should be captured on video; two groups will be picked at random to perform their peices in Class 9.

# Section 3: Case Study - The Map Room

In 2017, we turned the gymnasium of an abandoned school in St. Louis's North City and made it into a space for map-makign, data exploration, and dialogue. Since then, we've been workign to develop The Map Room as a wide-ranging platform to encourage social convening around data, and to critically question how people and communities are seen through data's lens. We'll introduce the project, and then run a map room of our own to see how it all works.

Readings, etc:

1. In the Map Room - https://medium.com/@blprnt/in-the-map-room-cd6b06bf2139
2. Mapping's Intelligent Agents (Shannon Mattern) - https://placesjournal.org/article/mappings-intelligent-agents/


Class 8 - 3/25/19 - Field Trip!
------------

Field Trip! We'll visit 2-3 public artworks in New York that put data into public space. We'll consider the multitude of design & commiunications considerations that ariste from making work which is physical, which exists in non-digital timescales, and which touches the quotidian experience of commuters, tourists, locals and passers-by.

Class 8 - 4/1/19 - The Map Room in Theory
------------

In the Map Room, Ccmmunity groups mapped hand-collected bicycle traffic data, community gardens, churches, magnet schools, and food banks. Groups of students mapped their schools, how they got there, and where it was or wasn’t safe. If mapping is a source of power, each mapper claimed some of it by making maps of their community that reflected them as they are, or that communicated what they’d like them to be. We'll learn more about the project, review work that influenced it, and make planse for how we can deploy a map room in Class 10.

- Introduction to The Map Room
- Guidelines for community engagement
- Working in groups, come up with ideas for a local-to-ITP Map Room

Also: Final Project ideas - see Class 6

### Resources: 

TBA

Guest Speaker: TBA


Class 9 - 4/8/19 - Data Liberation
------------

In the service of building a set of data layers to use for our Map Room, we'll investigate ways to make existing data sets more useful and more open. We'll also look at easy mechanisms for collecting data, and will investigate new low-cost ways for collecting environmental data.

Also: Data performances (see Class 7)

- Converting proprietory data sets into open formats
- Using map digitization and rectification workflows to make historical maps compatible with mapping software
- Tactics for citizen data collection

### Resources:

TBA

### Small Assignment: 

Identify a data set or archival map that could be used for our Map Room, and convert it to the necessary format (this will be explained in detail during class)


Class 10 - 4/15/19 - The Map Room in Practice
------------

- In-Class Map Room followed by discussion


# Section 4 - Data and the Anti-public

Both words - public and open - beg a question: for whom? Despite the efforts of Mae and Gareth, and Tim Grunder and many others, the internet as it exists is hardly a public space. Many people still find themselves excluded from full participation. How can our work speak to these inequities and perhaps offer ways to counter them?

1. Dark Matters - Introduction (Simone Brown) - https://www.scribd.com/document/283448443/Dark-Matters-by-Simone-Browne
2. The New Jim Code? Race, Carceral Technoscience, and Liberatory Imagination (Ruha Benjamin)- https://belonging.berkeley.edu/video-ruha-benjamin-new-jim-code-race-carceral-technoscience-and-liberatory-imagination
3. Indigenous Data Sovereignty (Tahu Kukutai) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfxC6HXY968


Class 11 - 4/22/19
------------

I'm teaching this class with a tonne of enthusiasm, though not, I admit, with a surfeit of hope. These have been difficult years. As I’m writing this, thousands of migrants sit in detention camps along this country’s southern border, their incarceration ‘optimized’ by face recognition and risk assessment algorithms. States are passing laws that would enable employers to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, a process that will be greatly enabled by high-tech HR systems with ‘social media monitoring’ built in as a feature. When I look at the training images for computer vision algorithms I keep checking for the face of my three year old son. The four companies that hold much of our data are worth a combined two and a half trillion dollars; to imagine ways to resist against these scales of power, financial, political, and computational, is daunting.

How can we take what we've learned in this class and put it into meaningful practice to push against oppressive structures?

- Data publics as activist spaces
- Data as disruption
